Alarms are blaring as you wake up out of cyrosleep on a spaceship, somewhere far far away.  The spaceship is deteriorating and you have 1 hour to fix the ship and get the materials you need to continue hyperspeed to your destination.

## MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION 
<br>
<br>

#### CREWMEMBER INTRODUCTION 


**SUBJECT**: Introduction to space exploration mission codename ‘SEE YA EARTH, intended for new crew members before launch. 

**INTRODUCTION**: Welcome [CREWMEMBER] to the crew for mission SEE YA EARTH, the most ambitious manned space expedition ever planned for human history.  You are joining a team of highly trained astronauts, scientists, engineers, and ventriloquists on a mission to boldly go where no human has gone before.   

**DESTINATION**: Your destination is Kepler 186f. Recent advances in telescope technology has enabled us to confirm the existence of water and an Earth-like climate.  Coupled with advances in faster-than-light (FTL) travel and cryo-sleep, we are finally able to send a manned expedition to establish a crewed research base for further development.   

**VEHICLE**: Your ship, the VCS Nuevo, is a class-3 starship equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including our newest version of a faster-than-light (FTL) engine, capable of reaching Kepler 186f in approximately 34 years. Crew members will spend most of this time in cryo-sleep, waking on staggered shifts for maintenance. The ship is fully automated, with advanced self-diagnostic systems in case of emergency. 

You represent the best and brightest of humanity – good luck and godspeed on your mission. 

Sincerely,
