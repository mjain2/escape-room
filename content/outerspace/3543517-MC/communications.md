Communications are out! Let's check the Morse satellite.

<!-- the above comment is to provide a blurb of the puzzle, do not remove -->


The ship has been trying to contact headquarters consistently, but every ping and packet has returned with an error.  Communications are entirely cut to the outside universe. 

Luckily, the ship has a state-of-the-art Morse satellite, but we’ll need to fill in a few pieces before it’s functional again. Use the clues in the document to insert letters into the empty spaces on the face of the satellite. Words should be read from the outermost ring in.
