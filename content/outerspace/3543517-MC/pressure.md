Oh, no! With the ship falling apart, all the pipes got knocked off from the wall and the cabin pressure is rapidly decreasing. To restore the ship’s pressure, replace each pipe by drawing a line from one opening on the left to the corresponding opening on the right. The chief engineer didn’t leave any instructions, but luckily she left some symbols to help you figure out where each pipe should go. Once you’re done, report back what’s leftover!
