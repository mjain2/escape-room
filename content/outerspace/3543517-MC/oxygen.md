Oxygen in the ship is at a critical level.  If oxygen is not replenished soon, cognitive function for the remaining crew members will significantly decline! Let's take a look at the Oxygen panel: 

The goal is to figure out the correct arrangement of oxygen atoms. ​

Rules​

1. The carbon atoms are represented in black and oxygen atoms in blue​
2. Oxygen atoms cannot be adjacent to each other, even diagonally. ​
3. Numbers next to rows and columns tell how many oxygens should be in them. ​
4. Each carbon atom needs 2 adjacent oxygens​
5. Utilize any number of oxygens as required​
6. Rotate the oxygen to attach​
7. Identify the location of oxygen atoms

If we look carefully enough, we may see the letters for two atomic symbols! Put them together to create the compound, and remember them as the keywords for this puzzle.
