Trip Around the Planet

<!-- the above comment is to provide a blurb of the puzzle, do not remove -->

Oh no, when we landed on Jupiter scavengers made off with our supplies and one of our crew!
It looks like our crewmate left a trail of letters, which might be a clue on how to find them. We
donâ€™t know the path they took, but we know they traveled across each place exactly once. We
have a map of Jupiter with possible routes from one place to another, but we need your help to
piece together their path. Can you figure out where our crewmate and supplies have been
taken
